# Machine-Learning
Some machine learning projects

This is a code to classify people as good or bad based on data collected from their social media.

The data is saved in a database table and i read it in using pandas

I used pca for the analysis (pricipal component anaysis) to get the fields the has high variance

Then i used the RandomForestClassifier

Just replace with your own data from database and split your y and X which are dependent and independent variables.
